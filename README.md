Freeboard Navigation Instruments and Chartplotter
=================================================

Freeboard is a new way to provide marine instruments and navigation tools over WIFI with low cost open hardware (Arduino and Raspberry Pi).

NEW: Freeboard interface pcb arrives. See https://www.42.co.nz/freeboard/news/custompcboardprototypearrives.html

Goals
-----

 * minimal cost
 * maximum interoperability
 * support compass, wind, log, autopilot, charts, and other common uses.
 * use low cost commodity hardware for sensors and processors
 * support modern devices (PC, tablets, cellphones)
 * support for many simultaneous users
 * total system cost (less clients) <USD500
 * use common KAP/BSB or ENC map formats (US NOAA Raster charts work)
 * low power usage (currently 0.4A at 12v)

Thats achieved in a totally unique way, by providing the instruments and chartplotter via a web page over a local wifi link on your boat, so that any device with a web browser can access them.

This is the main server for the Freeboard server project.
